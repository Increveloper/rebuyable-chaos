## What is this game?
The goal of this game is to buy rebuyable upgrades to increase your points. It uses BreakInfinity.js by Patashu to generate numbers above the 64-bit double floating point limit. This game is a side-project at the moment, as i have been having too many ideas to keep working on Resource Clicker, although i will come back to that later.
